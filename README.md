# ONLYOFFICE Integration App for Box

ONLYOFFICE integration app for Box allows working with office files directly within [Box](https://www.box.com/).

## How it works

ONLYOFFICE integration app allows users to open and edit the existing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations within Box.

Click the 3 dots icon to launch the file context menu, find **Integrations**, and select the **Open with ONLYOFFICE** option. The corresponding ONLYOFFICE editor will open in a new tab in the full screen mode.

It's also possible to collaborate on documents when sharing files with other Box users. 

_**Please note**: the app uses the pre-configured tenant of ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud and doesn't require any additional configuration._

## Supported file formats

* OOXML files, including DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, are opened directly for editing.
* ODT, ODP, ODS, TXT, CSV, RTF, EPUB, FB2 can be opened for viewing only, directly for editing with possible data loss due to format restrictions, or converted to OOXML for further editing.
